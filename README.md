## Introduction
This repository contains the work of our team for the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Challenge. Our task was to develop a statistical/machine learning model to predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension. We used various data science techniques including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
